## Color Harmony Notes

These colors were selected based on established color theory principles. The orange and yellow tones (
  - #F09712, #126bf0
  - #FF5733, #126bf0
  -  #FFD700
) work particularly well as they are complementary to blue3. 

The green shades (
  - #00FF7F,
  - #32CD32
) create an analogous harmony, while the purple (
    - #8A2BE2, #126bf0 - Purple
    - #FF69B4, #126bf0 - Pink
  ) tones offer split-complementary options4.

For the most harmonious combinations, consider using no more than 3-4 of these colors together in a single design1. The warm tones (oranges and yellows) will create the strongest contrast with your base blue, while the cooler tones (greens and purples) will create more subtle, sophisticated combinations.
